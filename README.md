# Greedy-Scheduling-Algorithms
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of two greedy scheduling algorithms for distributing tasks across multiple processors: Greedy and Greedy-Decreasing. These algorithms aim to efficiently assign tasks based on their execution time to optimize the Makespan (the total time required for all processors to finish execution).
